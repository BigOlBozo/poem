Hymn To Life
I Am Not Yours
I am shut out of mine own heart
I Am Still a Person
I am Trying to Break Your Heart
I Ask My Mother to Sing
I Cannot Live With You
I carry your heart with me
I Do Not Love You
i don’t know what living a balanced life feels
I Dream of Jeanie With The Light Brown Hair
I Dreamed That I Was Old
I Had Been Hungry all the Years
I have loved flowers that fade
I held a Jewel in my fingers
I know why the caged bird sings
I Love Thee
I Love to Do My Homework
I Love You
I Love You
I Love You
I Love You Mum
I love you with my every Breath
I Loved You First: but afterwards your love
I loved you...
I miss the days my friends
I shall imagine life
I Taught Myself To Live Simply
I Wandered Lonely As A Cloud
I Want to Apologize to All the Women
I want to go with the one I love...
I Wonder
I Wore This Dress Today for You, Mom
I'd Love to be a Fairy's Child
I'm a Little Teapot
I've Been Working on the Railroad
If a Lemon
If I Knew As A Child
If those I loved were lost
If You Can’t Go Over Or Under, Go Around
If You Forget Me
If You Have Seen
If You're Happy and You Know It
