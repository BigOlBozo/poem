               For a whim of bubble-blowing,
                  Perhaps to while an empty day,
               For a whim of stubble-sowing,
                  For a game at godlike play,
               Shall the bubbles in the drifting,
                  Pay the whim of Him who played?
               Shall the seedlets in the shifting,
                  Of the sifter be afraid?
