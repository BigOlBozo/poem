               O, my brothers, go not questing
                  For some mystic grail in vain -
               Why should ye a Master's jesting,
                  Strive to fathom or make plain?
               Wake ye from your fevered dreaming,
                  Groping for forbidden toys,
               All about you life is teeming,
                  Singing of ungarnered joys.
