               Surely He who somewhere hovers,
                  'Yond the reach of mortal ken,
               Gazing down on love and lovers,
                  Cannot blame the sons of men;
               Cannot blame his bubbles bursting,
                  Heart to heart and lips to lips;
               Cannot blame his seedlets thirsting
                  For the dew of honeyed lips.
