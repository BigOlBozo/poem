               Then that moment do not sadden,
                  Prayers, nor beads, nor aves tell;
               Then that moment do not madden
                  With mad dreams of heaven or hell;
               Trust that he who cast you idly,
                  Asked of you nor aye nor nay,
               Flung you idly, wildly, widely,
                  For his whim will not ask pay.
