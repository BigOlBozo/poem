Ah! my brothers, we are mortals,
                  Atoms on Time's ebb and flow,
               Soon we pass the dreary portals,
                  Soon to dreamless sleep we go;
               We are sparkles, evanescent,
                  Doomed to perish in the hour,
               And our time is in the present,
                  Ours but a moment's power.
