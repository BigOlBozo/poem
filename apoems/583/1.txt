               Love, my brothers, is the essence,
                  In the scheme of life and light;
               Birth and death are fearful lessons -
                  Out of darkness into night, -
               Thus we flash, a moment's living,
                  'Twixt the silent walls of death,
               Flashing for a moment, giving
                  Song but for a moment's breath.
