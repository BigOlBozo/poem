               Then again the golden chalice,
                  Once again a lingering draught;
               Surely He will bear no malice
                  For the pledge divinely quaffed.
               Thus, with sweet and fond caresses,
                  Hearts that beat with mutual bliss,
               He who loves is he who blesses,
                  Sealing heaven with a kiss.
