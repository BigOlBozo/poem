               Shall the playthings of a master,
                  Falling idly from his hand,
               Meet meritless disaster,
                  Meet with unearned reprimand?
               Shall the children of fancy,
                  Born a certain race to run,
               By an absurd necromancy,
                  Penance pay when it is done?
