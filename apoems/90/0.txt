Best Friends
The title we chose
But what does it mean to be "best friends"?
You should see each other every day?
Well that's not true for you and me
Should silly little fights get in our way?
Only if that's how it's meant to be
Should we give?
Should we borrow?
Should we dance like there's not tomorrow?
Secrets are traded
Privacy invaded
Hugs and smiles are shared
Tears are shed
Love is spread
We know that we both really cared
I smile, you smile
You cry, I cry
I wish, you wish
You die, I die
If you fall
I'll help you up
And if you call
I'll always pick up
Best Friends Forever
The promise we made
And I know in my heart
That it will never fade
