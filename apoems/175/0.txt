One beside another—brothers
Seven diviners
of what lies beyond the truths we have uncovered.
One makes three, then four, then more
until we move beyond mere numbers.
There is thunder over the city tonight
and of the million hearts we may never see
here in the circle we make commitments
we push the limits of earthly loving.
