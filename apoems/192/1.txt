Forgive and forget! there's no breast so unfeeling
But some gentle thoughts of affection there live;
And the best of us all require something concealing,
Some heart that with smiles can forget and forgive!
Then away with the cloud from those beautiful eyes
That brow was no home for such frowns to have met:
Oh! how could our spirits e'er hope for the skies,
If Heaven refused to forgive and forget.
