We meet today to sympathize
With Homestead men who seek redress;
Tosoothe with hope the widow's cries
And aid them in their sore distress....
Send forth the words on spirit wings
That wealth no longer shall maintain
In this free land,its petty kings.
With armed thugs to guard their reign.
With justice inthis noble fight
Wealth's private armies we defy;
With votes as weapons wielded right,
The cause of labor shall not die.
