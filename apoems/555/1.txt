To lose our Honour, and our Pleasure too,
Does both Ingratitude and Folly shew;
Therefore that Honour, which we can't defend
Without Assistance of an able Friend,
'Tis best resigning, since it is our Trust
Of Men of Honour makes them nobly just;
For 'tis the Pleasure of vain Liars most
Those Women's Favours, who refuse, to boast.
I yield to them, still to preserve a Name,
Exposing Modesty, to save my Fame:
I yield to Fools, and Wits, to Great and Small,
That none my Honour may in Question call,
Which, but to keep, I render up to all:
Since all Men (sure) must needs speak best of those,
Who, for their Love, their Honour most expose.
