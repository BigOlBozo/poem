The Old we sleep with but that Gold to take,
We give the Young for keeping us awake:
I to the Rich am of my Favours free,
That of their Coin they may be so to me:
And to the Poor I charitable prove,
Who, what they want in Gold, must give in Love.
Then if with old and poor Men I comply,
You may be sure I no Man can deny.
