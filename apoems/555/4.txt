The Lusty, and the Tall, my Liking claim,
Who hope Proportion is All o'er the same.
As oft I clasp the Little, and the Low,
In Hopes some Parts may make a goodlier Show;
(Since little Women oft are large below.)
I like the spare Man, for his slender Size,
As best by Nature form'd for Exercise;
The Fat, and Burly, equally approve,
Such are good-natur'd All, and Friends to Love.
I love the Black Man, since the warmer Friend;
The Fair, because more gentle, soft and kind:
Me, in their Turns, the Brown, or Aubourn take,
Only by diff'ring from the Fair or Black.
Nay I can love those, whom few like, the Red,
Who tho' they look worse up, are best in Bed.
Alike thus all Complexions me delight,
If that alike All seem to me by Night;
Of handsome Men I cannot but approve,
Who give me Pleasure, and engage my Love.
And to th' Ill-favour'd must good natur'd be,
Who (though I like them least) most plead, I see,
And still are ever satisfy'd with me.
