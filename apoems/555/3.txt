Too weak my Body, for the Bold, I find;
As, for the Gentle, much too weak my Mind.
By Force, the Rude my Ravisher will prove,
The Gentle is my Ravisher with Love;
The Flatt'rer gains me by his artful Praise,
The Libeller for fear of more Disgrace;
I to the Brave submit, because they ne'er
Boast of their Conquests, or expose the Fair:
To Cowards, since they dare not tell for Fear.
Me, the well-spoken, to Compliance move;
The Dumb, Distrustful, by their Silence prove
An aweful Modesty, Respect, and Love.
The fashionable Sparks my Fancy take,
Who go more fine, their better Court to make,
Less for their Pride, than for my Pleasure's sake.
To love th' Ill-dress'd, and Careless, I'm inclin'd,
Who less themselves, the more they love me, mind.
