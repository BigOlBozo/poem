How can I help my yielding to Mankind?
All are, alas! too hard for me, I find;
And, the Love-sickness of the Soul will make
The Spirit, for the potent Flesh, too weak.
Then since Resistance makes the Lover more
Exact his Vigour, and provokes his Pow'r,
The vain Repulsing of our Honour's Foes,
Us to their Passion does but more expose;
Why more than They should we our Credit lose,
Who can but ill th' Invader's Force oppose?
That which we can't defend, we must submit
To strong Perswasions urg'd by Love, or Wit;
And, not to lose our Honour, part with it;
Since sure our Honour more our Shame wou'd prove,
Made by our Pride, ungrateful to our Love:
If cruelly perverse, and simply coy,
We would prevent our Own and Lover's Joy:
And still the more he sued for our Embrace,
Be sullen, and refuse the courted Grace.
Shou'd I return him less, to make him more
My Foe, as more he was my Friend before;
By not submitting we the Lover make
Our Honour from Us, in Revenge, to take;
And by Perverseness set our Fame at Stake:
