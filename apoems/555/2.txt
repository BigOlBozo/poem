So that by Force, or Inclination, we,
To Love, and Lovers, must submissive be.
The Proud I favour, out of Pride to see
Them on their Knees, more willingly, to Me.
Since Men are brib'd to Silence by our Love,
Who, when deny'd, wou'd our Traducers prove.
The Humble, favour'd, think me free from Pride,
And with the Great and Proud I've oft comply'd,
But by my Shame to be more dignify'd.
The sturdy Ruffian makes me yield by Force.
The Gentle by the Pow'r of soft Discourse.
I yield to one, because by him compell'd,
To t' other, but because not forc'd, I yield.
An old Acquaintance makes me to comply
On the pure Score of Familiarity;
And 'tis uncivil Strangers to deny.
The Bully makes me out of Fear submit,
I yield, for fear of Scandal, to the Wit:
Nor can I This resist, or That prevent,
For Strength of Arms, of Back, or Argument;
Nor can I This reject, or That deny,
But yield to Love or Importunity.
