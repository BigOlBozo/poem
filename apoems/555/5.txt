Old Men (for being fond of me) I deem
Worthy my Friendship, tho' not my Esteem;
The Young, because they make me fond of them.
Old Men, since young Men for us they maintain,
The Young, since we, more Pleasure from 'em gain.
Old Men, because they get us not with Child,
By which our Fame were ruin'd, Beauty spoil'd;
Tho' happ'ly our advent'rous Ladies find,
They grow less pregnant, as the Men more kind.
