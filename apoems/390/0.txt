For those whom pray for us when times are harsh.
To these we doth confide our dearest love;
To stand alone to know that we've a friend,
A soul whom lives for us, and better still,
A being whom we trust with all our heart
Whom leaves our space and plays a life alone:
This is the greatest gift for one to have.
