When Einstein wrote of warps of space
He thought upon his lover's face
Which billowed in the waves of lace
Of stars that vanished without trace.
Diamonds they were, and glints of gold,
Lighting the night sky tale untold:
Their story one day would unfold
When came an artist to behold
And came an Einstein's space and time
And came a poet with his rhyme
And came a minstrel with his rhymezones
Linking the story and the timezones.
Deep in the canyon do I sing,
Naked as Ruth without her ring,
A blackbird with frost upon her wing,
Diamonds her frozen, glinting tears,
The warps of seconds and of years.
