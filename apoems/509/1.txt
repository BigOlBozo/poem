At break I pass out cookies.
Augustine, the Guatemalan, asks in Spanish,
"Teacher, what is ‘tally-ho'?"
I look at the word in the composition book.
I raise my face to the bare bulb for a blind answer.
I stutter, then say, "Es como adelante."
Augustine smiles, then nudges a friend
In the next desk, now smarter by one word.
After the cookies are eaten,
We move ahead to prepositions—
"Under," "over," and "between,"
Useful words when la migra opens the doors
Of their idling vans.
At ten to nine, I'm tired of acting,
And they're tired of their roles.
When class ends, I clap my hands of chalk dust,
And two students applaud, thinking it's a new verb.
I tell them adelante,
And they pick up their old books.
They smile and, in return, cry, "Tally-ho."
As they head for the door.
