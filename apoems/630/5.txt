The guardian seraphs had retired on high,
Finding their charges past all care below;
Terrestrial business fill`d nought in the sky
Save the recording angel`s black bureau;
Who found, indeed, the facts to multiply
With such rapidity of vice and woe,
That he had stripp`d off both his wings in quills,
And yet was in arrear of human ills.
