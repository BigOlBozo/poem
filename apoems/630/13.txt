Let`s skip a few short years of hollow peace,
Which peopled earth no better, hell as wont,
And heaven none — they form the tyrant`s lease,
With nothing but new names subscribed upon`t;
`Twill one day finish: meantime they increase,
`With seven heads and ten horns,` and all in front,
Like Saint John`s foretold beast; but ours are born
Less formidable in the head than horn.
