This by the way: `tis not mine to record
What angels shrink from: even the very devil
On this occasion his own work abhorr`d,
So surfeited with the infernal revel:
Though he himself had sharpen`d every sword,
It almost quench`d his innate thirst of evil.
(Here Satan`s sole good work deserves insertion —
`Tis, that he has both generals in reveration.)
