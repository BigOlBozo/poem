This was a handsome board — at least for heaven;
And yet they had even then enough to do,
So many conqueror`s cars were daily driven,
So many kingdoms fitted up anew;
Each day too slew its thousands six or seven,
Till at the crowning carnage, Waterloo,
They threw their pens down in divine disgust —
The page was so besmear`d with blood and dust.
