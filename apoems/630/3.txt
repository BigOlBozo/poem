The angels all were singing out of tune,
And hoarse with having little else to do,
Excepting to wind up the sun and moon,
Or curb a runaway young star or two,
Or wild colt of a comet, which too soon
Broke out of bounds o`er th` ethereal blue,
Splitting some planet with its playful tail,
As boats are sometimes by a wanton whale.
