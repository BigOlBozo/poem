In the first year of freedom`s second dawn
Died George the Third; although no tyrant, one
Who shielded tyrants, till each sense withdrawn
Left him nor mental nor external sun:
A better farmer ne`er brush`d dew from lawn,
A worse king never left a realm undone!
He died — but left his subjects still behind,
One half as mad — and t`other no less blind.
