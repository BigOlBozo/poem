Saint Peter sat by the celestial gate:
His keys were rusty, and the lock was dull,
So little trouble had been given of late;
Not that the place by any means was full,
But since the Gallic era `eight-eight`
The devils had ta`en a longer, stronger pull,
And `a pull altogether,` as they say
At sea — which drew most souls another way.
