All the stars’ twinkles say,
All through the night,
"This is the way to the realm of glory,"
All through the night.
Darkness is a different light
That exposes true beauty,
The Heavenly family in peace,
All through the night.
O, how cheerful smiles the star,
All through the night.
To light its earthly sister,
All through the night.
Old age is night when affliction comes,
But to beautify man in his late days,
We'll put our weak light together,
All through the night.
