         You lived on this bank first.
    While nine months filled your term, we knew
         how your lungs, immersed
    in the womb, miraculously grew
         their useless folds till
    the fierce, cold air rushed in to fill
them out like bushes thick with leaves. You took your hour,
    caught breath, and cried with your full lung power.
