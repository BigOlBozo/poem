         In the debris lay
    starlings, dead. Near the park’s birdrun
         we surprised one day
    a proud, tan-spatted, buff-brown pigeon.
         In my hands she flapped so
    fearfully that I let her go.
Her keeper came. And we helped snarl her in a net.
    You bring things I’d as soon forget.
