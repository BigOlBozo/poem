         You raise into my head
    a Fall night that I came once more
         to sit on your bed;
    sweat beads stood out on your arms and fore-
         head and you wheezed for breath,
    for help, like some child caught beneath
its comfortable woolly blankets, drowning there.
    Your lungs caught and would not take the air.
