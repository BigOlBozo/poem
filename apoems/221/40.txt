         You bring back how the red-
    winged blackbird shrieked, slapping frail wings,
         diving at my head—
    I saw where her tough nest, cradled, swings
         in tall reeds that must sway
    with the winds blowing every way.
If you recall much, you recall this place. You still
    live nearby—on the opposite hill.
