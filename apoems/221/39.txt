         Over the stagnant bight
    we see the hungry bank swallow
         flaunting his free flight
    still; we sink in mud to follow
         the killdeer from the grass
    that hides her nest. That March there was
rain; the rivers rose; you could hear killdeers flying
    all night over the mudflats crying.
