         After the sharp windstorm
    of July Fourth, all that summer
         through the gentle, warm
    afternoons, we heard great chain saws chirr
         like iron locusts. Crews
    of roughneck boys swarmed to cut loose
branches wrenched in the shattering wind, to hack free
    all the torn limbs that could sap the tree.
