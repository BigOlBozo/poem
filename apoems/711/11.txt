Exploding into brightness every spring,
I draw you close.   I wonder, do you know
how long I’ve wanted to be here?   Each year
you grasp me, lift me, carry me inside.
Glee is the body of the daffodil
reaching tubed fingers through the day, feeling
her own trumpeted passion choiring air
with hot, colored song.   This is a texture
I love.   This is life.   And, too, you love me,
inhale my whole being every spring.   Gone
winter, heavy clod whose icy body
fell into my bed.   I must leave you, but
I’ll wait through heat, fall, freeze to hear you cry:
Daffodils are up.   My God, what beauty!
