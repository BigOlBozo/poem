Down anyone’s street-bright invitations.
Suck ‘em.   Swallow ‘em.   Eat them whole.   That’s right,
be greedy about it.   The brightness calls
and you follow because you want to taste,
because you want to be welcomed inside
the code of that color: red for thirst; green
for hunger; pink, a kiss; and white, stain me
now.   Soil me with touching.   Is that right?
No?   That’s not, you say, what you meant.   Not what
you meant at all?   Pardon.   Excuse me, please.
Your hand was reaching, tugging at this shirt
of flowers and I thought, I guess I thought
you were hungry for something beautiful.
Come now.   The brightness here might fill you up.
