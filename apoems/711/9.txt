Come.   Now the brightness here might fill you up,
but tomorrow?   Who can know what the next
day will bring.   It is like that, here, in spring.
Four days ago, the dogwood was a fist
in protest.   Now look.   Even she unfurls
to the pleasure of the season.   Don’t be
ashamed of yourself.   Don’t be.    This happens
to us all.   We have thrown back the blanket.
We’re naked and we’ve grown to love ourselves.
I tell you, do not be ashamed.   Who is
more wanton than the dancing crepe myrtle?
Is she ashamed?   Why, even the dogwood,
that righteous tree of God’s, is full of lust
exploding into brightness every spring.
