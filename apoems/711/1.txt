Only now, in spring, can the place be named:
tulip poplar, daffodil, crab apple,
dogwood, budding pink-green, white-green, yellow
on my knowing.   All winter I was lost.
Fall, I found myself here, with no texture
my fingers know.   Then, worse, the white longing
that downed us deep three months.   No flower heat.
That was winter.   But now, in spring, the buds
flock our trees.   Ten million exquisite buds,
tiny and loud, flaring their petalled wings,
bellowing from ashen branches vibrant
keys, the chords of spring’s triumph: fisted heart,
dogwood; grail, poplar; wine spray, crab apple.
The song is drink, is color.   Come.   Now.   Taste.
