The song is drink, is color.   Come now, taste
what the world has to offer.   When you eat
you will know that music comes in guises—
bold of crepe myrtle, sweet of daffodil—
beyond sound, guises they never told you
could be true.   And they aren’t.   Except they are
so real now, this spring, you know them, taste them.
Green as kale, the songs of spring, bright as wine,
the music.   Faces of this season grin
with clobbering wantonness—see the smiles
open on each branch?—until you, too, smile.
Wide carnival of color, carnival
of scent.   We’re all lurching down streets, drunk now
from the poplar’s grail.   Wine spray: crab apple.
