From the poplar’s grail, wine spray.   Crab apple
brightens jealously to compete.   But by
the crab apple’s deep stain, the tulip tree
learns modesty.   Only blush, poplar learns,
lightly.   Never burn such a dark-hued fire
to the core.   Tulip poplar wants herself
light under leaf, never, like crab apple,
heavy under tart fruit.   Never laden.
So the poplar pours just a hint of wine
in her cup, while the crab apple, wild one,
acts as if her body were a fountain.
She would pour wine onto you, just let her.
Shameless, she plants herself, and delivers,
down anyone’s street, bright invitations.
