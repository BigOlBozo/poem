Once in a lifetime, you’ll find someone
who loves you for who you are,
no matter what your faults may be…
Once in a lifetime, you’ll find someone
who will tell you the truth about everything,
even if they’re afraid you won’t
like what you hear…
Once in a lifetime, you’ll find someone
who knows you better than
you know yourself,
and can always tell when you need a lift…
Once in a lifetime, you’ll find someone
who can make you smile,
even when your world seems like it’s crumbling around you…
I know I’ll never find a friend like you again,
because it only happens once in a lifetime…
