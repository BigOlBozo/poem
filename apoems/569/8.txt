If human sin confronts the rigid law
Of perfect truth and virtue, awe
Seizes and saddens thee to see how far
Beyond thy reach, perfection; if we test
By the ideal of the good, the best,
How mean our efforts and our actions are!
This space between the ideal of man's soul
And man's achievement, who hath ever past?
An ocean spreads between us and that goal,
Where anchor ne'er was cast!
