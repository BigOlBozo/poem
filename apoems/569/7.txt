But onward to the sphere of beauty. Go
Onward, O child of art! and, lo!
Out of the matter which thy pains control
The statue springs! not as with labor wrung
From the hard block, but as from nothing sprung
Airy and light the offspring of the soul!
The pangs, the cares, the weary toils it cost
Leave not a trace when once the work is done
The Artist's human frailty merged and lost
In art's great victory won!
