So, in the glorious parable, behold
How, bowed to mortal bonds, of old
Life's dreary path divine Alcides trod:
The hydra and the lion were his prey,
And to restore the friend he loved today,
He went undaunted to the black browed god;
And all the torments and the labors sore
Wroth Juno sent the meek majestic one,
With patient spirit and unquailing, bore,
Until the course was run
