I wanted to do something special for you,
so you would know how much
you are loved and appreciated. It always amazes me that you
can give so much of yourself,
and still be willing to do more whenever someone needs your help.
You are truly an inspiration,
and I would like to think
that I am a better person for knowing you.
I know sometimes it seems
as though all of your
hard work and devotion go unappreciated,
but people really do notice
how much you do for others. With each little gesture you make,
you change lives, even though
you don’t realize it.
It’s people like you who make
the world a better place,
and because you would never
admit that to yourself,
I wanted to say it to you.When God sends us angels,
they come to us as friends like you.
