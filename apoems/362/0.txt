Marry your best friend.
I do not say that lightly.
Really, truly find the strongest,
Happiest friendship
In the person you fall in love with.
Someone who speaks highly of you.
Someone you can laugh with.
The kind of laughs that make
Your belly ache, and your nose snort.
The embarrassing, earnest, healing kind of laughs.
Wit is important.
Life is too short not to love someone
Who lets you be a fool with them.
Make sure they are somebody
Who lets you cry, too.
Despair will come.
Find someone that you want
To be there with you
Through those times.
Most importantly,
Marry the one that makes passion,
Love, and madness combine
And course through you.
