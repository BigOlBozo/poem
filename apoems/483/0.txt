I see your strength
in your silence
oh wise one
where have you gone
I see your strength
in your beauty
oh great one
I see you
It is pure delight
that I know of you
I see your strength
in your muscles
oh magnificent one
I see your strength
in your peacefullness
it is pure delight
that I can say
I know of you.
