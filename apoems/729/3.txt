There comes a time
when snickers ripple a mixed audience
when you've referred to yourself as "young"
(the pubescent punks can't help themselves) .
You remember back on the unsteady cedar blaze of adolescence—
(glad it's just a memory) —
and you pity the "youngsters" who are still suffering through it.
