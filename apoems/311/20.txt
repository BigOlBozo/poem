Basketball is not real life, it's a past time, just another seasonal game,
However, people are treating this crap like life and death, that's insane,
Life &amp; death's played out for real on the battlefield of Afghanistan &amp; Iraq,
BTW, ever hear of the 13th Amendment? He didn't have to come back.
