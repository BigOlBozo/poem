Someone says Tristan
&amp; Isolde, the shared cup
&amp; broken vows binding them,
&amp; someone else says Romeo
&amp; Juliet, a lyre &amp; Jew’s harp
sighing a forbidden oath,
but I say a midnight horn
&amp; a voice with a moody angel
inside, the two married rib
to rib, note for note. Of course,
I am thinking of those Tuesdays
or Thursdays at Billy Berg’s
in LA when Lana Turner would say,
“Please sing ‘Strange Fruit’
for me,” &amp; then her dancing
nightlong with Mel Torme,
as if she knew what it took
to make brass &amp; flesh say yes
beneath the clandestine stars
&amp; a spinning that is so fast
we can’t feel the planet moving.
Is this why some of us fall
in &amp; out of love? Did Lady Day
&amp; Prez ever hold each other
&amp; plead to those notorious gods?
I don’t know. But I do know
even if a horn &amp; voice plumb
the unknown, what remains unsaid
coalesces around an old blues
&amp; begs with a hawk’s yellow eyes.
