With hair of fire and wings of midnight
blue, Beauty whispered with a smile so bright,
"Child, I am wherever you choose. Despair
shall never claim you, for I’m everywhere.
I am found in the whisper of the trees
that stir the light dance of the autumn leaves.
I am the joyous laugh of the flowers
and the tears of the angels through rain showers.
You see me when the sun kisses the moon.
You hear me when birds chirp their pretty tune".
