Don't call me anymore, Lenny Ross,
I've had about enough of you
and your constant chatter leading nowhere.
You can't keep quiet long enough to love me.
You touch my thigh, then start to babble economics,
then write a sentence down, then phone a friend,
remember I'm in bed and ask me
what I think of Bergman’s latest flick.
I can't take it anymore, Lenny Ross!
Genius, shit!  Just get it up and keep it up for once!
