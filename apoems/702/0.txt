My father’s hopes travel with me
years after he died. Someday
we will learn how to live.  All of us
surviving without violence
never stop dreaming how to cure it.
What changes? Crossing a small street
in Doha Souk, nut shops shuttered,
a handkerchief lies crumpled in the street,
maroon and white, like one my father had,
from Jordan.  Perfectly placed
in his pocket under his smile, for years.
He would have given it to anyone.
How do we continue all these days?
