Mom, there are no words
that can possibly express
how much you mean to me
and how much trust I feel for you.
you've given up so much for me,
more than I deserve.
no matter how bad it gets
I can always count on your smile.
when you laugh,
your eyes light up
much like the stars
in the night sky.
you're my shoulder to cry on,
my leg to lean on,
that rope that holds me together
so I don't break.
I hope you know I love you,
with every bit of my heart.
you're not only a mother to me,
you're a friend, a companion but most importantly..you're a gift
