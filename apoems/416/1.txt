              The rainbow comes and goes,
              And lovely is the rose;
              The moon doth with delight
Look round her when the heavens are bare;
              Waters on a starry night
              Are beautiful and fair;
   The sunshine is a glorious birth;
   But yet I know, where'er I go,
That there hath pass'd away a glory from the earth.
