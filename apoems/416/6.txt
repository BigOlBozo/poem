Earth fills her lap with pleasures of her own;
Yearnings she hath in her own natural kind,
And, even with something of a mother's mind,
              And no unworthy aim,
              The homely nurse doth all she can
To make her foster-child, her Inmate Man,
              Forget the glories he hath known,
And that imperial palace whence he came.
