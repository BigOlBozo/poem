The winds come to me from the fields of sleep,
              And all the earth is gay;
                      Land and sea
              Give themselves up to jollity,
                 And with the heart of May
              Doth every beast keep holiday;—
                 Thou Child of Joy,
Shout round me, let me hear thy shouts, thou happy Shepherd-boy!
