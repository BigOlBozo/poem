              O joy! that in our embers
              Is something that doth live,
              That nature yet remembers
              What was so fugitive!
The thought of our past years in me doth breed
Perpetual benediction: not indeed
For that which is most worthy to be blest—
Delight and liberty, the simple creed
Of childhood, whether busy or at rest,
With new-fledged hope still fluttering in his breast:—
                  Not for these I raise
                  The song of thanks and praise;
              But for those obstinate questionings
              Of sense and outward things,
              Fallings from us, vanishings;
              Blank misgivings of a Creature
Moving about in worlds not realized,
High instincts before which our mortal Nature
Did tremble like a guilty thing surprised:
                  But for those first affections,
                  Those shadowy recollections,
              Which, be they what they may,
Are yet the fountain-light of all our day,
Are yet a master-light of all our seeing;
       Uphold us, cherish, and have power to make
Our noisy years seem moments in the being
Of the eternal Silence: truths that wake,
              To perish never:
Which neither listlessness, nor mad endeavour,
              Nor Man nor Boy,
Nor all that is at enmity with joy,
Can utterly abolish or destroy!
              Hence in a season of calm weather
              Though inland far we be,
Our souls have sight of that immortal sea
              Which brought us hither,
          Can in a moment travel thither,
And see the children sport upon the shore,
And hear the mighty waters rolling evermore.
