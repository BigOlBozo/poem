Then sing, ye birds, sing, sing a joyous song!
              And let the young lambs bound
              As to the tabor's sound!
We in thought will join your throng,
              Ye that pipe and ye that play,
              Ye that through your hearts to-day
              Feel the gladness of the May!
What though the radiance which was once so bright
Be now for ever taken from my sight,
              Though nothing can bring back the hour
Of splendour in the grass, of glory in the flower;
              We will grieve not, rather find
              Strength in what remains behind;
              In the primal sympathy
              Which having been must ever be;
              In the soothing thoughts that spring
              Out of human suffering;
              In the faith that looks through death,
In years that bring the philosophic mind.
