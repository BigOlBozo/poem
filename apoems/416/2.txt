Now, while the birds thus sing a joyous song,
   And while the young lambs bound
              As to the tabor's sound,
To me alone there came a thought of grief:
A timely utterance gave that thought relief,
              And I again am strong:
The cataracts blow their trumpets from the steep;
No more shall grief of mine the season wrong;
I hear the echoes through the mountains throng,
