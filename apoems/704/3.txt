I'll tell you who I am as I sit here so still.
As I move at your bidding, eat at your will:
- I'm a small child of ten with a father and mother,
  Brothers and sisters who love one another;
- A young girl of sixteen with wings on her feet,
  Dreaming that soon a love she'll meet;
- A bride at twenty, my heart gives a leap,
  Remembering the vows that I promised to keep;
- At twenty-five now I have young of my own
  Who need me to build a secure, happy home.
- A woman of thirty, my young now grow fast.
  Bound together with ties that should last.
- At forty, my young sons have grown up and gone,
  But my man's beside me to see I don't mourn;
- At fifty once more babies play 'round my knee
  Again we know children, my loved ones and me...
