One day, a knight in shining armour may find my daughter,
and offer to save her from her life, her problems, her troubles.
In that situation, I hope that I have raised a girl
that she smiles coolly and tells him,
'No, thank you. I've very much got this.'
Then puts on her armour and rides off into the sunset alone
to save herself.
