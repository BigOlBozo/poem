Life presents things that bring us to our knees
It so seems so unfair to deal with such disease
Being the memory of my mother is a task like no other
Being the voice of my mother requires mindful talk
Being the hearing of my mother demands attentiveness
Being the task advisor for one so sweet is a blessing in disguise
She always puts me in her space
