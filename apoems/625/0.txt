Swift as a spirit hastening to his task
Of glory &amp; of good, the Sun sprang forth
Rejoicing in his splendour, &amp; the mask
Of darkness fell from the awakened Earth.
The smokeless altars of the mountain snows
Flamed above crimson clouds, &amp; at the birth
Of light, the Ocean's orison arose
To which the birds tempered their matin lay,
All flowers in field or forest which unclose
Their trembling eyelids to the kiss of day,
Swinging their censers in the element,
With orient incense lit by the new ray
Burned slow &amp; inconsumably, &amp; sent
Their odorous sighs up to the smiling air,
And in succession due, did Continent,
Isle, Ocean, &amp; all things that in them wear
The form &amp; character of mortal mould
Rise as the Sun their father rose, to bear
Their portion of the toil which he of old
Took as his own &amp; then imposed on them;
But I, whom thoughts which must remain untold
Had kept as wakeful as the stars that gem
The cone of night, now they were laid asleep,
Stretched my faint limbs beneath the hoary stem
Which an old chestnut flung athwart the steep
Of a green Apennine: before me fled
The night; behind me rose the day; the Deep
Was at my feet, &amp; Heaven above my head
When a strange trance over my fancy grew
Which was not slumber, for the shade it spread
Was so transparent that the scene came through
As clear as when a veil of light is drawn
O'er evening hills they glimmer; and I knew
That I had felt the freshness of that dawn,
Bathed in the same cold dew my brow &amp; hair
And sate as thus upon that slope of lawn
Under the self same bough, &amp; heard as there
The birds, the fountains &amp; the Ocean hold
Sweet talk in music through the enamoured air.
And then a Vision on my brain was rolled.
