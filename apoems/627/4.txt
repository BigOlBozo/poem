Here sits the Unicorn;
Head in a collar cased,
Like a girdle laced
Round a maiden's waist,
Broidered and buckled wide,
Carelessly tied.
He could slip his head
From the jewelled noose
So lightly tied -
If he tried,
As a maid could loose
The belt from her side;
He could slip the bond
So lightly tied -
If he tried.
